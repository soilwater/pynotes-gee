# Introduction {.unnumbered}

"PyNotes GEE" is a guide for agricultural professionals, environmental scientists, graduate students, and data enthusiasts looking to leverage the power of Python in conjunction with Google Earth Engine (GEE) to make better data-driven decisions, and understand and manage our planet's agricultural resources. 

Google Earth Engine is an advanced cloud-based platform designed for petabyte-scale analysis of geospatial data, particularly satellite imagery. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing and visualizing data, facilitating the extraction of meaningful insights from the Earth's surface over time. The powerful computing infrastructure behind GEE allows researchers to execute complex geospatial analyses that would be computationally intensive or infeasible on conventional laptops and desktop computers. Through its accessible interface, GEE enables automated processing pipelines using Python. 

Through a series of short, practical, and step-by-step tutorials in the form of Jupyter notebooks, this compendium provides a comprehensive toolkit describing common techniques for extracting, processing, and analyzing Earth data using Python libraries like Xarray, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, GeoPandas. The content is aimed at learners that are familiar with the Python programming language, but are just getting started with Google Earth Engine.
